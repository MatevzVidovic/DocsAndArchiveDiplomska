# Purpose
The main purpose of this repo is to be the docs of code for the project Diplomska.
It aslo serves as an archive of old code and the sbatch and yaml files used to run an iteration of trying out models 
(after the iteration is done we have to keep the main workspace clean for the next iteration so it remains workable).
The archive also stores the weights of old models, but those are gitignored because of size.
