# Purpose
The main purpose of this repo is to be the docs of code for the project Diplomska.
And for archiving various things that are not needed, at least for the moment.
The point is to have a repo that can change a bunch and have a bunch of commits, 
and they don't litter the actual commits of the actual code which can then stay clear and concise.

It also serves as an archive of old code and the sbatch and yaml files used to run an iteration of trying out models 
(after the iteration is done we have to keep the main workspace clean for the next iteration so it remains workable).
The archive also stores the weights of old models, but those are gitignored because of size.
